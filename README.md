# Accelerated-PCA-

## Intoduction
This repo contains implementation of [Accelerated Stochastic Power Iteration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02670.pdf) in three settings, based on adding a momentum term to the power iteration.

There are three variations of power method which we'll implement here:
* Deterministic Power iteration.
* Deterministic Power iteration with momentum.
* Stochastic Power iteration with momentum.
